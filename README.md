# PhishingEmailAnalysis

## Description
This project analyzes a dataset of emails to find words that commonly appear in phishing emails. Using Pythong in Google Colab, the emails are cleaned, tokenized, and counted to see which words show up most often. Simple charts and word clouds to help visualize patterns in phishing language.

##Features

Cleans and preprocesses raw email text
Counts word frequencies in phishing emails
Generates charts and word clouds to visualize results
Python notebooks run in Google Colab for easy access

## Technologies Used
-Python
-Google Colab
-WordCloud

## How to Run

1. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  
2. Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`)  
3. Upload the dataset file to Colab  
4. Run the cells to see the analysis and visualizations  


## Dataset

This project uses a Kaggle phishing email dataset

## Optional Enhancements
- Add more advanced NLP preprocessing  
- Create a classifier to automatically detect phishing emails  
- Explore word correlations and patterns across different email types
