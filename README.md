# PhishingEmailAnalysis
This project looks at a bunch of emails to find the words that show up most in phishing emails. I used Python in Google Colab to clean up the text, count word frequencies, and make simple charts and word clouds to see patterns. It helps understand what kind of words scammers use in emails.
